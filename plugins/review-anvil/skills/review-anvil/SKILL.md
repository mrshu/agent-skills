description: Iteratively refine code via N rounds of parallel subagent review and orchestrator-applied fixes. Use when the user says "let's do three rounds", "fix/review loop", "back-and-forth review", "iterative review", or asks to harden a change with multiple rounds of codex/claude review. Configurable rounds, agent count/mix, focus, and target.

# review-anvil — Iterative Multi-Agent Fix/Review Loop

Wrap a code change in **N rounds of parallel reviewer subagents + orchestrator-applied fixes**. Each round = (parallel review by M agents) → (you synthesize findings) → (you apply fixes, commit) → next round.

## How to Use

The user invokes the skill with a free-form args string. Parse it to extract these parameters:

| Param | Default | Plain-English forms |
|---|---|---|
| `rounds` | `3` | "5 rounds", "three rounds", "do 4 passes" |
| `agents` | `3` | "3 agents", "2 reviewers", or a mix like `"2 codex + 1 claude"`, `"three claude reviewers and one codex"` |
| `focus` | the four pillars (correctness, maintainability, simplicity, production blast-radius) | "focus on async correctness", "only: security" (the `only:` prefix replaces defaults instead of appending) |
| `target` | auto-detect | "PR #42", "branch", "uncommitted", "src/auth/", "last 3 commits" |

### Parsing rules

- `agents` may be a single number (use the default mix policy below) **or** a plain-English mix. If a mix is given, honor it exactly. The mix may name `codex`/`codex-exec` or `claude`/`claude-exec`.
- `focus` defaults are *appended* to user input. If the user prefixes their focus with `only:`, replace defaults with their list.
- `target` auto-detection precedence (when not specified):
  1. Currently checked-out PR (run `gh pr view --json number,headRefName 2>/dev/null`); if a PR is found, use its diff.
  2. Else, if the current branch differs from `main`, use the branch-vs-main diff (`git diff main...HEAD`).
  3. Else, use uncommitted changes (`git diff` and `git diff --cached`).
- If the args string is missing or empty, use all defaults.

### Example invocations

- `Skill review-anvil` → 3 rounds, default mix (2 codex + 1 claude), default four-pillar focus, auto-detected target.
- `Skill review-anvil "5 rounds, 2 codex + 1 claude, focus: async correctness, target: PR #42"`
- `Skill review-anvil "1 round, only: security, target: src/auth/"`
- `Skill review-anvil "three rounds, three claude reviewers"` → 3 rounds × 3 claude-exec.

## Default Mix Policy

When the user gives a count but no mix, pick the mix from this table:

| `agents` | Mix |
|---|---|
| 1 | 1 codex-exec |
| 2 | 1 codex-exec + 1 claude-exec |
| 3 | 2 codex-exec + 1 claude-exec |
| 4 | 2 codex-exec + 2 claude-exec |
| 5 | 3 codex-exec + 2 claude-exec |
| N | ~60/40 codex/claude split, codex gets the odd one |

Rationale: codex-exec tends to surface more issues per call in our usage, so it gets the larger share. When `agents=1` we use codex-exec for the same reason.

## Loop Mechanics

(6-step round procedure — Task 4)

## Reviewer Prompt Template

(context + task blocks — Task 5)

## Output Format

(final report + per-round status — Task 6)

## Edge Cases

(failure handling, target detection, parse fallback — Task 6)
